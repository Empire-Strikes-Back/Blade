i am peerdb library - database, best of orbitdb and datomic

- i sync data over ipfs pubsub, like orbitdb, but i have datomic interface and design (i'm not sure i need time travel)
- i don't need orbit's eventlog/docstore/feed - like in datomic, eventlog is tranasaction log, else is high level abstraction for querying
- all i store everything as ipfs data
